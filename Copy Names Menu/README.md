# Copy Names Menu	
A contextual menu for Robofont’s Font Overview panel that enables you to copy the names of the selected glyphs to your clipboard in the format of your choosing. 

The code is [Erik van Blokland](http://letterror.com/)’s useful `copyNamesToClipboard.py` [here](https://github.com/LettError/editThatNextMaster/blob/master/copyNamesToClipboard.py), combined with the Robofont’s generously provided wrapper code for building contextual menus [here](https://robofont.com/documentation/building-tools/toolspace/observers/custom-font-overview-contextual-menu/?highlight=menu).

This is a script currently designed to be implemented as a [start-up script](https://robofont.com/documentation/how-tos/setting-up-a-startup-script/?highlight=start-up).
