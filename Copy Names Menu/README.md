# Copy Names Menu	
A contextual menu for Robofont’s Font Overview panel that enables you to copy the names of the selected glyphs to your clipboard in the format of your choosing. 

The code is Erik van Blokland’s `copyNamesToClipboard.py` [here](https://github.com/LettError/editThatNextMaster/blob/master/copyNamesToClipboard.py), combined with the Robofont-provided wrapper code for building contextual menus.

This is a script currently designed to be implemented as a [start-up script](https://robofont.com/documentation/how-tos/setting-up-a-startup-script/?highlight=start-up).
