# Scripts for quickly setting up CJ ideographs in RoboFont.

These simple scripts should each provide a basic setup in your UFO for working with Chinese Hanzi or Japanese Kanji, adding new glyphs, establishing box guides, changing vertical metrics, manipulating RF preferences. 

**CJ\_ufo_setup\-quick.py** just establishes guides and a few test characters. 
**CJ_ufo_setup.py** generates 300 basic Hanzi and 300 arbitrary Kanji.
In either one, feel free to change the list of glyphs you need to generate.

Thanks to TienMin Liao for the idea and help!
